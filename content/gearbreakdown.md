Title: Gear Breakdown
Date: March 1, 2015
Category: Gear

Living out of a backpack for five months takes some very careful planning.  Everything that you carry on your back should have a purpose, maybe even two or three.  The idea is to keep weight to a minimum while trying to stay comfortable and safe.  I've made a few weight concessions in order to keep my comfort level higher.

If you're looking for just a list with weights, check out my [gear list]({filename}/pages/gear.md).  If you have any questions about anything you do or don't see here, please leave me a comment.

As it stands now, my **base pack weight** hovers around 15 pounds.  This number includes everything carried in your backpack except for *consumables*, which are typically food, water, and fuel.  Many people are able to get their base pack weight to 10 pounds or under, while others are closer to the 20 pound mark.  With all of that said, gear selection is very personal.  There are probably more arguments over gear than there are about gay marriage or taxation.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to photograph everything.  Some things I just didn't take a picture of and others I haven't bought yet.  Use your imagination.

# The Big Three

Your backpack, shelter, and sleeping bag are typically the three main contributors to your base pack weight.  I also like to include my sleeping pad in this category as it's a pretty major part of my pack.

####Backpack
***ULA Circuit***

This bag is extremely popular on the PCT and for good reason.  It's relatively light, has large pockets on the hip belt, and stands up to a beating.  It's fits very comfortably on me and I have no complaints about it.

####Shelter
***Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 Tent***

Another piece of popular PCT gear.  This tent is a great compromise between weight and space.  A big part of choosing a tent for me was finding one with enough space inside.  I like that I am able to fit myself and my bag inside this tent.  I wouldnt' say it's spacious, but it's definately not a tight squeeze.

####Sleeping Bag
***Enlightened Equipment Revelation 20° Quilt***

Not a lot of people outside of the through hiker or ultralight backpacking communities are familiar with quilts.  For three season camping, I much prefer this style of sleeping bag because it lets me thermoregulate better.  While a sleeping bag zips up on one side and completely closes, a quilt often times only has a few snap buttons along one edge and no hood.  Because I sleep on the warmer side, this system lets me thermoregulate better.  It also usually means lower weights.

####Sleeping Pad
***Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Xlite***

Many hikers take those folding foam sleeping pads on their PCT hike.  For the most part, these pads tend to help with heat loss to the ground, but they don't do much for comfort.  Getting a good night's sleep is extremely critical for hiking 15 to 20 miles per day, so I don't want to cut any corners here.

# Hydration

####Containers
***Evernew Water Bladders and Disposable Water Bottles***

It's important to have access to plenty of water throughout the 2,650 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.  This year, more than ever, it's important to be able to carry enough water through the parts of the West Coast plagued by drought.  For me, this means having the ability to carry six liters of water.  In the desert, I'll need to use every one of my bottles along with other disposable bottles I'll buy at markets along the way.  In more northern sections, I'll be able to get away with only carrying one or two liters at a time.

####Water Treatment
***AquaMira Chlorine Dioxide Drops***<br>
***Sawyer Squeeze Mini Filter***

Being able to carry all of this water wouldn't mean much if I couldn't drink it.  In order to not contract giardia or other waterborne pathogens, I'll need to treat most of my water throughout the whole trip.  I'll be using AquaMira chlorine dioxide drops to treat most of my water.  This two-part system takes about 30 minutes to start working.  In order to have instant clean water and as a backup to my drops, I'll also carry a Sawyer Mini filter along with it's plunger to clean out any gunk that builds up inside.

# Kitchen

Most hikers aren't eating gourmet meals on the trail everynight.  Breakfast is typically a couple meal bars, Poptarts, or even a Snickers.  Instead of lunch, hikers normally graze all day which means smaller, quick snacks like trail mix, tortillas and peanut butter, chips, and Snickers.  Dinner is where most hikers take time to sit down and eat a hot meal.  Still though, this is usually some sort of dehydrated meal like ramen, Knorr sides, Mountain House, or probably just more Snickers.

Because I won't need much more than boiling water to cook my meals, I've chosen to carry a Jetboil all-in-one system.  The pot locks onto to the stove and can boil water in under three minutes.  I'll also carry a long handled spoon to get to the bottom of those deep meal bags.

I think I'll also add a lightweight plastic container and lid if I feel like I need an extra bowl to mix things in.

# Toiletries

There isn't much out of the ordinary here.  That orange thing in the bottom left is an ultralight shovel for digging poop holes.  As part of the "Leave No Trace" philosphy, most hikers dig a big hole before the poop for pretty obvious reasons.  Everything else is pretty self-explanatory.

My first aid kit will take some tweaking, but I'll be carrying blister care, chafe prevention, antibiotic ointment, gauze for DIY bandaids, ibuprofen and/or Aleve, and some sort of foot cream.

# Electronics

Even though this trip is very much about getting out into the wilderness and living with less, some electronic devices are necessary.  

I had originally planned to bring a small point and shoot camera, but my phone takes good enough pictures.  I'll use my [StickPic](http://www.thestickpic.com/), which attaches to the end of my trekking pole, as a sort of selfie stick to get better angles.  As well as a camera, my phone will function as my internet access, water report, map, and of course, telephone.

While walking 20 miles per day and listening to the sounds of nature sounds therapeutic, it gets boring at times.  To help with this I'm bringing along a small MP3 player loaded with my favorite music, podcasts, and audiobooks.  I'll be able to refill the memory card when I stop in town.  Using this instead of my phone for music will keep my phone charged for more important uses.

To charge both the phone and MP3 player on the trail, I'll use a small rechargable battery which I'll charge in towns.  This should get me about two full phone charges just in case I run out of juice.

The SPOT personal locator is a satellite GPS messenger which allows for GPS locating in remote areas.  The device sends a message to SPOT's servers with my location every hour which will be updated on this [map]({filename}/pages/map.md) as I go.  The device also allows me to call for an emergency helicopter lift, just in case.

# Clothing

For the majority of the hike, I'll be wearing the same clothing every day.  Depending on the weather, I may trade out a long sleeve shirt for a short sleeve, or shorts for pants.  But for the most part, I'll be wearing the same smelly and dirty clothes for five months, washing them once per week or so.

####Rain/Wind Gear
***Patagonia Houdini Wind Jacket***<br>
***Euroschirm Umbrella***

When it gets windy or starts to rain, I'll put on my water resistant wind shirt.  I'll also be carrying a reflective umbrella, both to shade myself from the sun and protect against rain.  When I get into the wetter areas of Oregon and Washington, I'll likely add a dedicated rain jacket for extra weather protection.

####Cold Weather Gear
***Montbell Ex Light Down Anorak***<br>
***Beanie and Gloves***

When the temperatures drop in the evening, I'll need to slip into warmer clothes.  I practically live in this down jacket right now and I love it.  It's extremely lightweight and packs down very small.

####Sleeping Clothes

***Patagonia Capilene 3 Long Sleeve Shirt***<br>
***Smartwool Long Johns***<br>
***Wool Socks***

It's important to change out of your wet, smelly, dirty hiking clothes and into something cleaner and warmer at night.  This keeps a lot of your dirt and body oils off of your sleeping bag, which helps it keep its insulative properties.  I find it also helps having an evening routine of changing into different clothes to help keep a sense of normality on the trail.
