Title: I quit my job yesterday.
Date: February 27, 2015
Category: Intro

I quit my job yesterday so I could hike the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs over 2,600 miles and connects the Mexican border in Campo, CA to the Canadian border just inside British Columbia, Canada.

My plan is to leave Campo on April 21 and hike my way through what can be considered five major sections: **Southern California**, **the Sierras**, **Northern California**, **Oregon**, and **Washington**. After the first 45 days and 700 miles and right as we come upon the Sierras, I'll leave the trail for a week for a friend's wedding.  Then, from around the middle of June straight through to the end of September, it'll be back to living out of a backpack stuffed with everything I could need.

Writing on this site is extremely helpful to organize a trip like this.  All of the posts I make are just as much help to me as they are interesting for others to read.  I hope to post here as often as possible on the trail.  Internet service is understandably unreliable in the middle of the wilderness.

A bit more about the trail can be found [here]({filename}/the_pct.md).  Living out of a backpack for five months requires some specialty gear which you can read [about here]({filename}/gearbreakdown.md).  I'll be carrying a GPS device which should update [this map]({filename}/pages/map.md) in real time, so be sure to check back often.
