Title: I quit my job yesterday.
Date: February 27, 2015

I quit my job yesterday so I could hike the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs over 2,600 miles and connects the Mexican border in Campo, CA to the Canadian border just inside British Columbia, Canada.
- - -
My plan is to leave Campo on April 21 and hike my way through what can be considered five major sections: **Southern California**, **the Sierras**, **Northern California**, **Oregon**, and **Washington**. After the first 45 days and 700 miles and right as we come upon the Sierras, I'll leave the trail for a week for a friend's wedding.  Then, from around the middle of June straight through to the end of September, it'll be back to living out of a backpack stuffed with everything I could need.

The trail starts out in the Colorado and Mojave deserts and then mainly follows the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges.  After passing through the deserts of Southern California the PCT quickly climbs into the High Sierra.  Many people say that this is their favorite part of the trail and it's not surprising why.  After enduring up to 30 mile stretches without reliable water sources in the desert, snow covered mountains become plentiful, and with them snowmelt.

On top of the much improved water situation, the trail weaves past countless crystal blue mountain lakes and even detours up the highest point in the lower 48 states, Mt. Whitney at 14,494 feet.  Once back down from Mt. Whitney, the trail crosses eight named passes above 11,000 feet, starting with the official highest point on the trail at 13,153 feet, Forester Pass.  The Sierra Nevada ends as the trail passes through Yosemite and Lake Tahoe and the Cascades begin.  Granite gives way to volcanic rock when Mt. Lassen comes into view after which the PCT turns west toward Mt. Shasta and through the Trinity Alps.  California finally comes to an end at Interstate 5 near Siskiyou Summit and the trail enters Oregon.

After California's brutal desert and Sierra peaks, Oregon brings both the shortest and the easiest portion to hike.  Passing Ashland to the west, the trail runs directly along the Rim of Crater Lake, then past Bend, the Three Sisters and Mt. Hood near Portland.  The only major elevation change in Oregon is the 3,160 foot drop into the Columbia River Gorge crossing the Columbia River on the awesomely named Bridge of the Gods into Washington.

Just as the trail descends into the Gorge, it climbs right back out in Washington and rounds the base of Mt. Adams.  The terrain turns glacial as Mt. Rainier towers in the distance and the trail enters the North Cascades.  Once through Snoqualmie Pass, the PCT climbs up a deep canyon to a high mountain pass, only to descend another deep canyon and repeat the cycle.  Spotted throughout the alpine land are small towns such as Skykomish and Stehekin.  In this section, it's not uncommon to walk 75 miles without seeing a road or another person without stopping into town.  Wrapping up the adventure, the Pacific Crest Trail passes around Glacier Peak and over the Canadian border into Manning Provincial Park.
