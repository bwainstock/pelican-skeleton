This is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down.  And I'd like to take a minute so just sit right there;  I'll tell you all about how I became the prince of Bel Air.

In West Philadelphia, born and raised - on the playground is where I spent most of my days.  Chillin' out maxin', relaxin' all cool, shootin' some b-ball outside the school.  When a couple of guys, they were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood.  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.  She said, "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air."

I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.  If anything, I could tell that this cab was rare, so I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes!  To Bel Air!"

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later!"  I looked at my kingdom, and I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
