Hi, I'm Barry!  I am a <strong><span style="color: #1DAD63">computer nerd</span></strong> and I love the <strong><span style="color: #1DAD63">outdoors</span></strong>.  If I'm not hiking, I'm probably playing <strong><span style="color: #1DAD63">soccer</span></strong>.  I quit my job to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, so if you know of anyone hiring around October, let me know!

I was born and raised in Los Angeles, moved to Santa Cruz for college, lived in Portland for a year doing typical Portland things, and now I call the <strong><span style="color: #1DAD63">San Francisco Bay Area</span></strong> home.

I will try my hardest to update this site as often as possible.  Please <strong><span style="color: #1DAD63">leave comments and ask questions</span></strong> as I hike from Mexico to Canada.  It could get lonely out there.
