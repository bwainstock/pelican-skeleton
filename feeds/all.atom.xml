&lt;p&gt;Near Tule Spring I creep up behind a guy with a huge pack. When I pass him he says something about getting passed by a girl. Then he speeds up to match me and I slow down to talk to him. He’s a total junk show, his pack towers three feet over his head and things dangle and sway as he ambles about. I talk to him about his pack but it’s useless, he doesn’t seem motivated to change. He’s out of snacks so I leave him some pretzels at the water cache. “Hey!” he yells as I hasten my pace “They should call you speed racer!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the water cache I meet more hikers: Mac, a gentle Kiwi who wears huaraches. East coasters Dewy and Masshole, buddies from the AT. And Mama Bear, a sassy kinda girl who wears trucker hats.&lt;/p&gt;
