&lt;p&gt;Near Tule Spring I creep up behind a guy with a huge pack. When I pass him he says something about getting passed by a girl. Then he speeds up to match me and I slow down to talk to him. He’s a total junk show, his pack towers three feet over his head and things dangle and sway as he ambles about. I talk to him about his pack but it’s useless, he doesn’t seem motivated to change. He’s out of snacks so I leave him some pretzels at the water cache. “Hey!” he yells as I hasten my pace “They should call you speed racer!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the water cache I meet more hikers: Mac, a gentle Kiwi who wears huaraches. East coasters Dewy and Masshole, buddies from the AT. And Mama Bear, a sassy kinda girl who wears trucker hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Paradise Cafe I inhale a burger, two beers, and smoke two marlboros.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="December"></category></entry><entry><title>120822</title><link href="barryhikesthepct.com/120822.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-02-08T10:20:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Barry Wainstock</name></author><id>tag:,2010-02-08:barryhikesthepct.com/120822.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This particular section of trail is uninspiring.
